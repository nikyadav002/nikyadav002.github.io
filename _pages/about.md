I am a PhD researcher in the Department of Chemistry at IIT Delhi, where my work focuses on computational design and atomistic understanding of next-generation optoelectronic and energy materials. My research integrates first-principles electronic-structure methods, ab-initio and machine-learning-accelerated molecular dynamics, and data-driven modelling to uncover structure–property relationships governing charge-carrier dynamics, defects, and excited-state processes in soft semiconductors. My primary research interests include halide perovskites, chalcogenides, and metal–semiconductor heterostructures, with an emphasis on hot-carrier physics, non-adiabatic processes, and materials discovery using interpretable machine learning. Through close collaboration with experimental groups, my work aims to develop predictive design principles for stable, high-performance materials for optoelectronic and energy-conversion applications.
